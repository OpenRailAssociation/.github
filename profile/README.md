Welcome to the GitHub organization of the [OpenRail Association](https://openrailassociation.org). Here we host the official [OpenRail projects](https://openrailassociation.org/#projects) and some administrative repositories. Projects are incubated according to the [OpenRail incubation process](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/blob/main/incubation_process.md). We have another GitHub organization [OpenRail-Playground](https://github.com/OpenRail-Playground) for very early or experimental projects.
